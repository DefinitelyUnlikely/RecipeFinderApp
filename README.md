# Recipe Finder App

## What is the goal of this application?
The goal of this application is to create a web application that allows users to enter ingredients and be given back a recipe that matches those ingredients. 
The desired search functionality would be one where the user may pick if they want the recipe to contain/not contain all the ingredients and if the recipe may only contain the stated ingredients.


## Who is the targeted demographic for this application?
- Anyone who has ever opened up their refrigerator and thought to themselves: "I would like to make something out of the stuff in here, but I have no idea what to do".
- People that loves a certain ingredient and wants more recipes with their favorite thing in it.
- For those of us who don't want to waste food but just have no clue what to do with a block of tofu, half a chicken and some cucumber that has seen better days.
