I'm making a list of possible APIs to use for my recipes. 

1. https://www.themealdb.com/api.php upside: free, has a test API key for the purpose of development or education. You can even pay later, if you want to use the key in
production/release your thing to the public. i.e. if I do decide to make an actual website and not just a showcase, I can still use this API. 
downside: The free API does not have a way for me to get all meals. You also need premium to do multi-ingredient searches. meaning it might not be suitable 
for anything BUT an actual product. i.e. my showcase would either have to share my API key (ain't happening) or not have access to multi-ingredient searches.
