So, Ill have a homepage, an about us page and a page where you actually search for recipes. 
Most likely I'll add a 4th page that is for the recipe itself. 

I'm probably opting out of having a navbar. I might have a header, but that will only contain buttons for navigation on 
some of the pages I think. We'll see exactly how I'll want to do this. I'm currently thinking I'm going for a very simple design.

The homepage should be very simple and is mainly a way to see the webpage at its most simplest form. 
Two buttons in the middle of the page, one for getting to the actual recipe finding page and one for getting to the about us page.

Color scheme? I feel a recipe site is mostly associated with brighter colors and a light theme.
A white background can be a little dull - I'm thinknig gradiant. And I'm thinking a peachlike color scheme.
