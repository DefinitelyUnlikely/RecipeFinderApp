So, Ill have a homepage, an about us page and a page where you actually search for recipes. 
Most likely I'll add a 4th page that is for the recipe itself. 

I'm probably opting out of having a navbar. I might have a header, but that will only contain buttons for navigation on 
some of the pages I think. We'll see exactly how I'll want to do this. I'm currently thinking I'm going for a very simple design.

The homepage should be very simple and is mainly a way to see the webpage at its most simplest form. 
Two buttons in the middle of the page
