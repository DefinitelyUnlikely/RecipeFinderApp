I've changed my mind on some of the design choices. 

I think I'll go for having buttons for navigation at the bottom of the page.
On a phone in landscape, navigation should instead be to the side. 

Content still in the middle. 

I think I'll remove the divs inside the pages and just have them be in the outlet by default.
Then have a div around the outlet if needed. I think this is easier in terms of making the css consistent across the page.
